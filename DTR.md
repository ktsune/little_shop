Project: Little Shop

Group Member Names: Glynnis O’Connell and Sarah Tatro

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?): Sarah - what sessions, cookies, and POROS are, to use path helpers to solidify knowledge of MVC, to learn how to work with larger databases and creating sad paths, utilizing them in testing, as well as working with FactoryBot/Faker. 
Glynnis - solidify sessions and cookies, dealing with statistics and their views on the app

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here): Communicate as much as needed, doing all the work I can on my own, pairing when necessary. Treat each other like human beings, done with Slack around 9pm, usually checking in on it around 8/8:30 daily in the morning. We’ll use Slack unless there’s an emergency/panic attack, and we’ll exchange our cell phone numbers for that. Sarah - very reliable, will keep working on a problem until it’s figured out
Glynnis - enthusiastic, always time box myself and reach out for help if I’ve tried everything else
We both feel pretty confident with the MVC architecture, TDD, pretty comfortable with GH merge conflicts.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles: We’re not afraid to ask any little question
Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?): We both work out 2-3 times a week, Sarah in the morning, Glynnis in the afternoon/evening. We’re available to work together at Turing during work time, but prefer to work on our own. We’ll check in daily around 8:30am, or during project work time. With the long weekend, we’ll meet up Saturday morning/afternoon to discuss work, any issues, etc. at Roostercat Too on Lincoln.
Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?): Everyday via Slack or class time, we’ve also exchanged cell phone numbers. 
Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?): Split it down the middle, divide and conquer, seek help when needed!
Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): No one will be merging their own PR’s, and if something needs to be merged urgently, we’ll text one another.
Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: We’re both pretty blunt, and highly empathetic, so as long as we treat each other like human beings with respect and kindness
Project management tools we will use: Github Projects
